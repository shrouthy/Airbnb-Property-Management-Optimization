# Airbnb-Property-Management-Optimization
A data-driven analysis of Airbnb listings using Tableau to uncover pricing trends, host performance, and seasonal booking patterns — aimed at optimizing rental strategy and guest experience.

**Objective:**  
Analyze Airbnb listings to optimize rental strategy, pricing, and host performance using data-driven insights delivered through Tableau.

**Key Highlights:**  
1. Geographic & Seasonal Trends: Uncovered how listings, bookings, and availability fluctuate across cities and seasons.
2. Pricing & Rating Correlation: Revealed that higher prices don't guarantee better ratings — value perception matters.
3. Host Performance Analysis: Compared superhosts vs. regular hosts; superhosts show stronger metrics across the board.
4. Engagement Insights: Assessed guest satisfaction via review frequency and rating breakdown (cleanliness, communication, etc.).
5. Amenities Impact: Identified how listing features like bathrooms and guest capacity influence booking decisions.

**Tools Used:**  
Tableau – Developed interactive dashboards to visualize booking trends, pricing behavior, and host performance.

**Insights:**  
1. Superhosts drive higher engagement and revenue → Encourage more hosts to qualify.
2. Budget listings can earn high ratings when core expectations (cleanliness, communication) are met.
3. Strong regional and seasonal booking patterns → Ideal for dynamic pricing and inventory planning.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Promote high-rated, budget listings in seasonal campaigns.
2. Focus on quality factors over luxury to raise review scores.
3. Use booking trends to prevent oversupply in low-demand periods.
